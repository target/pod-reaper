# pod-reaper: kills pods dead
A rules based pod killing container. Pod-Reaper was designed to kill pods that meet specific conditions. See the "Implemented Rules" section below for details on specific rules.

Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/target/pod-reaper/

## Configuring Pod Reaper
Pod-Reaper is configurable through environment variables. The pod-reaper specific environment variables are:

- `NAMESPACE` the kubernetes namespace where pod-reaper should look for pods
- `SCHEDULE` schedule for when pod-reaper should look for pods to reap
- `RUN_DURATION` how long pod-reaper should run before exiting
- `EXCLUDE_LABEL_KEY` pod metadata label (of key-value pair) that pod-reaper should exclude
- `EXCLUDE_LABEL_VALUES` comma-separated list of metadata label values (of key-value pair) that pod-reaper should exclude
- `REQUIRE_LABEL_KEY` pod metadata label (of key-value pair) that pod-reaper should require
- `REQUIRE_LABEL_VALUES` comma-separated list of metadata label values (of key-value pair) that pod-reaper should require

Additionally, at least one rule must be enabled, or the pod-reaper will error and exit. See the Rules section below for configuring and enabling rules.

Example environment variables:
```
# pod-reaper configuration
NAMESPACE=test
SCHEDULE=@every 30s
RUN_DURATION=15m
EXCLUDE_LABEL_KEY=pod-reaper
EXCLUDE_LABEL_VALUES=disabled,false

# enable at least one rule
CHAOS_CHANCE=.001
```

#### `NAMESPACE`
Default value: "" (which will look at ALL namespaces)

Controls which kubernetes namespace the pod-reaper is in scope for the pod-reaper. Note that the pod-reaper uses an `InClusterConfig` which makes use of the service account that kubernetes gives to its pods. Only pods (and namespaces) accessible to this service account will be visible to the pod-reaper.

#### `SCHEDULE`
Default value: "@every 1m"

Controls how frequently pod-reaper queries kubernetes for pods. The format follows the upstream cron library https://godoc.org/github.com/robfig/cron. For most use cases, the interval format `@every 1h2m3s` is sufficient. But more complex use cases can make use of the `* * * * * *` notation.

#### `RUN_DURATION`
Default value: "0s" (which corresponds to running indefinitely)

Controls the minimum duration that pod-reaper will run before intentionally exiting. The value of "0s" (or anything equivalent such as the empty string) will be interpreted as an indefinite run duration. The format follows the go-lang `time.duration` format (example: "1h15m30s"). Pod-Reaper will finish waiting for, and running another reap cycle if the duration elapses during a poll interval: so there will always be exactly one cycle after the run duration has elapsed.

#### `EXCLUDE_LABEL_KEY` and `EXCLUDE_LABEL_VALUES`
These environment variables are used to build a label selector to exclude pods from reaping. The key must be a properly formed kubernetes label key. Values are a comma-separated (without whitespace) list of kubernetes label values. Setting exactly one of the key or values environment variables will result in an error.

A pod will be excluded from the pod-reaper if the pod has a metadata label has a key corresponding to the pod-reaper's exclude label key, and that same metadata label has a value in the pod-reaper's list of excluded label values. This means that exclusion requires both the pod-reaper and pod to be configured in a compatible way.

#### `REQUIRE_LABEL_KEY` and `REQUIRE_LABEL_VALUES`

These environment variables build a label selector that pods must match in order to be reaped. Use them the same way as you would `EXCLUDE_LABEL_KEY` and `EXCLUDE_LABEL_VALUES`.

## Implemented Rules

### Chaos Chance
Flags a pod for reaping based on a random number generator.

Enabled and configured by setting the environment variable `CHAOS_CHANCE` with a floating point value. A random number generator will generate a value in range `[0,1)` and if the the generated value is below the configured chaos chance, the pod will be flagged for reaping.

Example:
```
# every 30 seconds kill 1/100 pods found (based on random chance)
SCHEDULE=@every 30s
CHAOS_CHANCE=.01
```

Remember that pods can be excluded from reaping if the pod has a label matching the pod-reaper's configuration. See the `EXCLUDE_LABEL_KEY` and `EXCLUDE_LABEL_VALUES` section above for more details.

### Container Status
Flags a pod for reaping based on the container status.

Enabled and configured by setting the environment variable `CONTAINER_STATUSES` with a coma separated list (no whitespace) of statuses. If a pod is in either a waiting or terminated state with a status in the specified list of status, the pod will be flagged for reaping.

Example:
```
# every 10 minutes, kill all pods with status ImagePullBackOff, ErrImagePull, or Error
SCHEDULE=@every 10m
CONTAINER_STATUSES=ImagePullBackOff,ErrImagePull,Error
```

### Duration
Flags a pod for reaping based on the pods current run duration.

Enabled and configured by setting the environment variable `MAX_DURATION` with a valid go-lang `time.duration` format (example: "1h15m30s"). If a pod has been running longer than the specified duration, the pod will be flagged for reaping.

## Running Pod-Reapers

### Combining Rules:
A pod will only be reaped if ALL rules flag the pod for reaping, but you can achieve reaping on OR logic by simply running another pod-reaper.

For example, in the same pod-reaper container:
```
CHAOS_CHANCE=.01
RUN_DURATION=2h
```
Means that 1/100 pods that also have a run duration of over 2 hours will be reaped. If you want 1/100 pods reaped regardless of duration and also want all pods with a run duration of over hours to be reaped, run two pod-reapers. one with: `CHAOS_CHANCE=.01` and another with `RUN_DURATION=2h`.

### Deployments
Multiple pod-reapers can be easily managed and configured with kubernetes deployments. It is encouraged that if you are using deployments, that you leave the `RUN_DURATION` environment variable unset (or "0s") to let the reaper run forever, since the deployment will reschedule it anyway. Note that the pod-reaper can and will reap itself if it is not excluded.

### One Time Runs
You can run run pod-reaper as a one time, limited duration container by usable the `RUN_DURATION` environment variable. An example use case might be wanting to introduce a high degree of chaos into your kubernetes environment for a short duration:
```
# 30% chaos chance every 1 minute for 15 minutes
SCHEDULE=@every 1m
RUN_DURATION=15m
CHAOS_CHANCE=.3
```
